How to get POSTed JSON in Flask
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20001229/how-to-get-posted-json-in-flask
    -> use force=True ?


I am able to run the index.html (in ~/development/prototyping/javascript/analytics) with CORS,
but for this to work I had to specify headers in api_root()

I can also navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5001/
a.js will get loaded, so the POST request will come from the same domain.


TODO
====
1. Read and understand Cross-Domain Requests
    I want to POST data to my app
2. Read: UA plugins explained (analytics)
